An app made for tourists (using Laravel & React) in major cities around the world. It provides a way to quickly access the most common phrases used in various situations in English (e.g. Cafe,Train Station,Bar etc) and when you select a phrase you can see the translation (in the local language) and hear the pronunciation.
<br>
<br>
What is more the app provides you with a second option where you can see the local map with various points of interest and by selecting what you want to visit it provides you with various info about the place and also most used phrases (again with the same functionallity as the previous feature).
